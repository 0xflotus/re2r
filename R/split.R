#' Split strings with a pattern.

#' @param pattern a pre-compiled regular expression or a string
#' @param string a character vector
#' @param part number of pieces to return. Default (Inf) uses all possible split positions.
#' @param parallel use multithread
#' @param grain_size a minimum chunk size for tuning the behavior of parallel algorithms
#' @param ... further arguments passed to or from other methods.
#' @examples
