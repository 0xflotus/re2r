#' Replace a pattern in strings.
#'
#' Replace the first match of "pattern" in "str" with "rewrite".
#' Within "rewrite", backslash-escaped digits (\\1 to \\9) can be
#' used to insert text matching corresponding parenthesized group
#' from the pattern.  \\0 in "rewrite" refers to the entire matching
#' text. Vectorised over string, pattern and replacement.
#'
#' @param pattern a pre-compiled regular expression or a string
#' @param replacement replace the first match or all of the match of "pattern" in "input" with "rewrite"
#' @param string input character vector
#' @param parallel use multithread
#' @param grain_size a minimum chunk size for tuning the behavior of parallel algorithms
#' @param ... further arguments passed to or from other methods
#' @return a character vector
#' @examples
#' regexp = re2("b+")
#' re2_replace_all("yabba dabba doo", regexp,"d") == "yada dada doo"
