#' Replace matched patterns in a string.
#'
#' Replace the first match of "pattern" in "str" with "rewrite".
#' Within "rewrite", backslash-escaped digits (\\1 to \\9) can be
#' used to insert text matching corresponding parenthesized group
#' from the pattern.  \\0 in "rewrite" refers to the entire matching
#' text.
#'
#' @param pattern a pre-compiled regular expression or a string
#' @param rewrite replace the first match or all of the match of "pattern" in "input" with "rewrite"
#' @param input a character vector
#' @param all if it is TRUE, it will replaces successive non-overlapping occurrences
#' @param parallel multithreading support
#' @param ... further arguments passed to or from other methods.
#' @return a character vector
#' @examples
#' regexp = re2("b+")
#' re2_replace("yabba dabba doo", regexp,"d") == "yada dada doo"
#' re2_replace("yabba dabba doo", "b+","d", all = FALSE) == "yada dabba doo"
