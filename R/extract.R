#' Extract one matched patterns in a string.
#'
#' Like Replace, except that if the pattern matches, "rewrite"
#' is copied into "out" with substitutions.  The non-matching
#' portions of "text" are ignored.
#'
#' Returns true iff a match occurred and the extraction happened
#' @param pattern a pre-compiled regular expression or a string
#' @param rewrite replace the first match of "pattern" in "input" with "rewrite"
#' @param input a character vector
#' @param ... further arguments passed to or from other methods.
#' @examples
#' re2_extract("yabba dabba doo", "(.)")
#' re2_extract("test@me.com", "(.*)@([^.]*)", "\\2!\\1")
#' @export
