#' Extract a pattern in strings.
#'
#' Like re2_replace, except that if the pattern matches, substring is copied into the result. The non-matching
#' portions of "text" are ignored.
#'
#' @param pattern a pre-compiled regular expression or a string
#' @param input a character vector
#' @param parallel use multithread
#' @param anchor UNANCHORED: no anchor. ANCHOR_START: anchor match at the beginning of the string. ANCHOR_BOTH: anchor match at the beginning and the end of the string.
#' @param grain_size a minimum chunk size for tuning the behavior of parallel algorithms
#' @param ... further arguments passed to or from other methods.
#' @examples
#' re2_extract("yabba dabba doo", "(.)")
#' @export
