\title{Extract a pattern in strings with multithread.}
\usage{
re2_pextract(input, pattern, rewrite = "\\\\1", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{a character vector}

\item{pattern}{a pre-compiled regular expression or a string}

\item{rewrite}{replace the first match of "pattern" in "input" with "rewrite"}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}

Like re2_preplace, except that if the pattern matches, "rewrite"
is copied into "out" with substitutions.  The non-matching
portions of "text" are ignored.
}
\details{
Returns true iff a match occurred and the extraction happened

\examples{
re2_pextract("yabba dabba doo", "(.)")
